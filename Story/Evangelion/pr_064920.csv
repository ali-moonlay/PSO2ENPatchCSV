pr_064920_0010#0,"""<%me>.<br>Sorry to have brought you all the way here, but there's someone I'd like you to meet."""
pr_064920_0020#0,"""Misato, this is <%me>."""
pr_064920_0030#0,"""<%me>, it's a pleasure to meet you.<br>I'm Misato Katsuragi of the special agency, NERV."""
pr_064920_0040#0,"""Special agency?"""
pr_064920_0050#0,"""NERV?"""
pr_064920_0060#0,"""Correct. These children are also members of NERV.<br>Introduce yourselves, you three."""
pr_064920_0070#0,"""Um... I'm Shinji Ikari. It's nice to meet you."""
pr_064920_0080#0,"""I'm the pilot of Evangelion Unit-02, Asuka Langley Sohryu."""
pr_064920_0090#0,"""...Rei Ayanami."""
pr_064920_0100#0,"""No way... These people are characters from..."""
pr_064920_0110#0,"""...You're familiar with it, then."""
pr_064920_0120#0,"""<%me>, have you heard of \""Evangelion\""?"""
pr_064920_0130#0,"""It's one of the most popular anime around. And these four look, sound and act exactly like characters from that anime..."""
pr_064920_0140#0,"""That's why we stepped in to protect these Phantoms. I know, it's hard to believe."""
pr_064920_0150#0,"""Hey, you! Don't let this Enga guy tell you we're just Phantoms or whatever!"""
pr_064920_0160#0,"""Calm down, Asuka. Let's hear what else he has to say."""
pr_064920_0170#0,"""Shut up, idiot! He's just gonna say we were embodied from people's strong feelings or something dumb like that. Right?!"""
pr_064920_0180#0,"""As if anyone would believe that rubbish!"""
pr_064920_0190#0,"""I find it hard to believe too, but..."""
pr_064920_0200#0,"""Ugh, you're pathetic!"""
pr_064920_0210#0,"""Asuka, calm down. That's not where he's going with this."""
pr_064920_0220#0,"""Tch."""
pr_064920_0230#0,"""<%me>.<br>Enga has explained the situation to me, so I understand how your people see us."""
pr_064920_0240#0,"""This Earth is very different from the Earth we know."""
pr_064920_0250#0,"""In this world, \""Evangelion\"" is a work of fiction."""
pr_064920_0260#0,"""And the four of us are characters from it, materialized in the real world..."""
pr_064920_0270#0,"""But as Asuka says, that is a difficult thing to accept. This idea that we are fictional characters."""
pr_064920_0280#0,"""That's how you feel, huh? Well, I can't say I don't get it."""
pr_064920_0290#0,"""Um, Misato, what do you think has happened?"""
pr_064920_0300#0,"""Xiera, isn't it? We have two guesses."""
pr_064920_0310#0,"""Shinji's idea was that this Earth is in a dimension parallel to our own."""
pr_064920_0320#0,"""Something has brought us to this world, but we don't know what it is, or why."""
pr_064920_0340#0,"""Asuka's theory is that this world is an illusion, and that we're being subjected to some form of mass hypnosis."""
pr_064920_0350#0,"""Yeah, if anyone's the fake people here, it's you!"""
pr_064920_0360#0,"""Well, we don't have any evidence for either of those hypotheses..."""
pr_064920_0370#0,"""But to me, they both sound more credible than the idea that we're fictional characters."""
pr_064920_0380#0,"""I understand the situation. So, what do you need from us?"""
pr_064920_0390#0,"""Well, whatever the truth is, we can't keep Misato and the others here."""
pr_064920_0400#0,"""We've gotta to figure out how to send them home."""
pr_064920_0410#0,"""Yes, we must return to our own world as soon as possible."""
pr_064920_0420#0,"""You can say that again. I don't want to spend a second longer in a world like this than I have to."""
pr_064920_0430#0,"""But we don't have any idea how we're gonna do that. We've done everything we can here at Earth Guide."""
pr_064920_0440#0,"""Enga has informed us that your people have technology unknown to the people of Earth."""
pr_064920_0450#0,"""Therefore, we must ask for your cooperation in finding a way to return us to our world."""
pr_064920_0460#0,"""When Phantoms have personalities, they can be unembodied by giving them whatever it is they want."""
pr_064920_0470#0,"""Whatever we have to make them think, the way to deal with this will be by making their wishes come true."""
pr_064920_0480#0,"""I hate to have to keep coming to you with this stuff, but could you help us out?"""
pr_064920_0490#0,"""Please, help us."""
pr_064920_0500#0,"""Ah, um...<br>Please..."""
pr_064920_0510#0,"""Hmph, I'm not exactly used to asking my dreams for help."""
pr_064920_0520#0,"""..."""
pr_064920_0530#0,"""Well, <%me>?<br>What do you want to do?"""
pr_064920_0540#0,"""We'll do everything we can."""
pr_064920_0550#0,"""We'll help."""
pr_064920_0560#0,"""Understood! I, Xiera, will support you in every way I can as well!"""
pr_064920_0570#0,"""Thank you, sincerely."""
pr_064920_0580#0,"""That said, I don't really know how we're going to send you back..."""
pr_064920_0590#0,"""Emergency message?! Wait right there!"""
pr_064920_0600#0,"""What in the world...<br>Woah, what the heck is this?!"""
pr_064920_0610#0,"""What is it, Xiera?"""
pr_064920_0620#0,"""Ah, um...<br>I think you should see this for yourselves. I'll bring it up on your monitor!"""
pr_064920_0630#0,"""...!"""
pr_064920_0640#0,"""No way, that's..."""
pr_064920_0650#0,"""It couldn't be...!"""
