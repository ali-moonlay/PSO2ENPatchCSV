pr_064950_0010#0,"""Everyone, thank you for your hard work in making the Sixth Angel Eradication Operation a success! Shinji, Misato, congratulations."""
pr_064950_0020#0,"""Thank you, Xiera. And thank you to all your ARKS for their help."""
pr_064950_0030#0,"""No, we'd never have been able to destroy that huge Phantom by ourselves. We owe it all to you."""
pr_064950_0040#0,"""Um... Still, I want to thank <%me> for drawing the Angel's attention."""
pr_064950_0050#0,"""You did your best too."""
pr_064950_0060#0,"""It was a close thing."""
pr_064950_0070#0,"""Th-thank you very much!"""
pr_064950_0080#0,"""Hey, Shinji! Don't try to make out like First and I didn't do anything!"""
pr_064950_0090#0,"""That's true. I thought we were done for until Asuka and Ayanami jumped in..."""
pr_064950_0100#0,"""That's right, Shinji! Don't try to make out like First and I didn't do anything!"""
pr_064950_0110#0,"""Uh-huh, you two were both really helpful."""
pr_064950_0120#0,"""Hm-hmm. Thank you, thank you.<br>Hey, you, you're being praised too. Got anything to say?"""
pr_064950_0130#0,"""...I'm glad you are safe, Ikari."""
pr_064950_0140#0,"""Still, I'm surprised you were able to use those, uh, what were they called... A.I.S.?"""
pr_064950_0150#0,"""Yeah, it was a bit last minute, but we got them trained up just in time to help out."""
pr_064950_0160#0,"""So that was what you wanted them for..."""
pr_064950_0170#0,"""Right. We wanted as many people who had experience with Angels as possible in the fight, so we had them prepare in secret."""
pr_064950_0180#0,"""To speed the training along, we threw together a steering mechanism based on Eva Unit-01's Entry Plug."""
pr_064950_0190#0,"""As I expected, their experience as Eva pilots helped them pick it up very quickly."""
pr_064950_0200#0,"""Of course we did! Compared to an Eva, that thing was basically a toy!"""
pr_064950_0210#0,"""I was only following my mission."""
pr_064950_0220#0,"""I'm glad it worked out in the end, but that was a very dangerous thing to do."""
pr_064950_0230#0,"""Well, it worked out for me, too. I got some valuable non-ARKS piloted A.I.S. battle data."""
pr_064950_0240#0,"""This will really help out with A.I.S. R&D, so you won't hear any complaints from me."""
pr_064950_0250#0,"""*Sigh*... You didn't turn us into robots, but you still used us as lab rats."""
pr_064950_0260#0,"""Ahaha..."""
pr_064950_0270#0,"""Ahaha."""
pr_064950_0280#0,"""Eheheh..."""
pr_064950_0290#0,"""..."""
pr_064950_0300#0,"""Oh, look at your bodies!"""
pr_064950_0310#0,"""Huh?"""
pr_064950_0320#0,"""What's going on?"""
pr_064950_0330#0,"""Is this..."""
pr_064950_0340#0,"""Seems it's time we said our farewells."""
pr_064950_0350#0,"""So destroying the Angel was the condition for our return after all."""
pr_064950_0360#0,"""ARKS, I thank you once again."""
pr_064950_0370#0,"""You may have many battles left to fight, but know that from our far-off world, we are praying for your success."""
pr_064950_0380#0,"""I'll... I'll never forget this!"""
pr_064950_0390#0,"""Shinji?"""
pr_064950_0400#0,"""Working with all of you to defeat that Angel, even though we barely knew each other...<br>It made me... happy."""
pr_064950_0410#0,"""Yes, I'm glad that I met you, too."""
pr_064950_0420#0,"""Hm, I didn't really like this world at first, but I guess it was kinda fun in the end."""
pr_064950_0430#0,"""If you ever need our help again, I'll be here in a flash with Unit-02!"""
pr_064950_0440#0,"""Oh, you'd bring that weapon here?! That's quite a promise. Well, I'll remember you said that."""
pr_064950_0450#0,"""Goodbye."""
pr_064950_0460#0,"""Take care."""
pr_064950_0470#0,"""Until we meet again."""
pr_064950_0480#0,"""*Sigh*...<br>I guess they all went home..."""
pr_064950_0490#0,"""Xiera?"""
pr_064950_0500#0,"""Hey, <%me>. I kind of wonder... Do you think Shinji and the others really were Phantoms?"""
pr_064950_0510#0,"""What do you mean?"""
pr_064950_0520#0,"""I was wondering the same."""
pr_064950_0530#0,"""You know, what if they really were people from a parallel world similar to this one?"""
pr_064950_0540#0,"""You too?!"""
pr_064950_0550#0,"""The Eva and the Angel were definitely Ether constructs."""
pr_064950_0560#0,"""But I never did confirm that Shinji and the rest were."""
pr_064950_0570#0,"""Huh? Really?"""
pr_064950_0580#0,"""Yep. Like I said, there's still a lot we don't know about Phantoms and embodiment."""
pr_064950_0590#0,"""Some paranormal entities can't be explained simply as an image in someone's mind. Deus Esca, for one."""
pr_064950_0600#0,"""It's plausible that Ether particles could create a vessel to be inhabited by a paranormal entity, or the soul of a person from another world..."""
pr_064950_0610#0,"""Maybe that's what happened here."""
pr_064950_0620#0,"""In that case... Shinji, are you really out there...?"""
pr_064950_0630#0,"""Dear me, that was an illogical thing for a researcher to be saying. Just forget it."""
pr_064950_0640#0,"""Still... I hope we see them again some day... Oh, I know!"""
pr_064950_0650#0,"""Next time there's a new Evangelion release, let's ask Xiao if he wants to go to Earth and see it!"""
pr_064950_0660#0,"""We could invite Hitsugi, Kohri, Enga...<br>And you have to come too, <%me>!"""
