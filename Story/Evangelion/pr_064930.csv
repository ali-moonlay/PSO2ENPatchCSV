pr_064930_0020#0,"""Evangelion Unit-01 just suddenly appeared in the Shop Area..."""
pr_064930_0030#0,"""We've invited Misato and her team to spend a week aboard Oracle in order to investigate."""
pr_064930_0040#0,"""Ludmilla's helping us on this one. She's been collecting her findings, so she should be able to brief us soon."""
pr_064930_0050#0,"""Everyone's gathering in the Operational Planning Room. Let's go."""
pr_064930_0060#0,"""These \""Evangelions\"" are just full of surprises."""
pr_064930_0070#0,"""I never thought I'd see other types of human-piloted weapons besides A.I.S."""
pr_064930_0080#0,"""Ludmilla, what were you able to learn about it?"""
pr_064930_0090#0,"""Right, right. From studying it, I was able to conclude..."""
pr_064930_0100#0,"""It's an Evangelion, but it's not an Evangelion. That's the best way to explain it."""
pr_064930_0110#0,"""I don't understand."""
pr_064930_0120#0,"""That Eva Unit-01 certainly looks like the Eva we know."""
pr_064930_0130#0,"""But under the surface, it's very different in composition."""
pr_064930_0140#0,"""So it's just a statue?"""
pr_064930_0150#0,"""So it's a replica?"""
pr_064930_0160#0,"""No, it's a special design that blends Oracle technology with the original Eva tech."""
pr_064930_0170#0,"""It's not a replica, but it's not just an immobile statue either."""
pr_064930_0180#0,"""I couldn't fully analyze it, but by following the process Misato explained, we were able to get it working with just our tech."""
pr_064930_0190#0,"""However, we're limited in terms of who can pilot it."""
pr_064930_0200#0,"""What do you mean?"""
pr_064930_0210#0,"""Let me explain. In our world, Evangelions can only be piloted by a small number of people."""
pr_064930_0220#0,"""Eva Unit-01 can only be piloted by Shinji Ikari."""
pr_064930_0230#0,"""And only Shinji was able to control the Unit-01 that appeared in this world."""
pr_064930_0240#0,"""Shinji, how did it feel when you were using it?"""
pr_064930_0250#0,"""Using the Entry Plug felt almost exactly the same as usual."""
pr_064930_0260#0,"""In other words, the Eva Unit-01 that's appeared in this world is very similar to the Eva we know, but..."""
pr_064930_0270#0,"""While it's a perfect imitation of the original's appearance, it's been reproduced in such a way that it works with this world's technology."""
pr_064930_0280#0,"""But it's still the case that only Shinji can pilot it. I wonder why...？"""
pr_064930_0290#0,"""U-um..."""
pr_064930_0300#0,"""What is it, idiot? If you've got something to say, speak up."""
pr_064930_0310#0,"""O-okay. This world, whether it's a parallel world or whether you're right about it being a kind of dream..."""
pr_064930_0315#0,"""There must be some reason for us being here."""
pr_064930_0320#0,"""Like, maybe we have some sort of mission we need to complete..."""
pr_064930_0330#0,"""If we do that, will we return home?"""
pr_064930_0340#0,"""Yeah. I'm not sure, but that's the feeling I'm getting..."""
pr_064930_0350#0,"""...What? Are you a complete moron?! This isn't some dumb fairy story where we have to complete a challenge if we want to leave. Get your head out of your books once in a while!"""
pr_064930_0360#0,"""No, I don't think we can discount the possibility."""
pr_064930_0370#0,"""What the heck are you saying, Misato?"""
pr_064930_0380#0,"""We must approach this logically."""
pr_064930_0390#0,"""It could well be that there's some condition we have to meet if we want to return."""
pr_064930_0400#0,"""Yeah. I guess that would make sense if this is a dream, but..."""
pr_064930_0410#0,"""Fine. You actually had a bright idea for once, idiot."""
pr_064930_0420#0,"""Aha..."""
pr_064930_0430#0,"""So if I understand correctly, this Eva's appeared, and only Shinji is able to control it..."""
pr_064930_0440#0,"""And you think that means you have some kind of mission...<br>Am I following you so far?"""
pr_064930_0450#0,"""Yes, I think so."""
pr_064930_0460#0,"""I've got to say, the fact that so few people can operate this thing really impacts on its versatility. That's a serious drawback for any weapon."""
pr_064930_0470#0,"""That's why we Eva pilots are so special!"""
pr_064930_0480#0,"""...But why the heck was that idiot Shinji's Unit the only one that got reproduced?"""
pr_064930_0490#0,"""If there's something we've gotta do, my Unit-02 would be way better!"""
pr_064930_0500#0,"""Hey, teacher's pet, don't you wish you had your Unit-00?!"""
pr_064930_0510#0,"""Mine... only comes when it's needed."""
pr_064930_0520#0,"""Ugh! Why are you always so..."""
pr_064930_0530#0,"""Emergency alert?!<br>Confirming the situation now!"""
pr_064930_0540#0,"""Come on, what is it now?!"""
pr_064930_0550#0,"""Detecting signs of the appearance of a super-massive Phantom in the ARKS Ship Urban District!"""
pr_064930_0560#0,"""...It's so big! There's no way anything could be that huge! Putting the target on-screen now!"""
pr_064930_0570#0,"""...！"""
pr_064930_0580#0,"""Is that what I think it is?!"""
pr_064930_0590#0,"""Huh...?! The super-massive Phantom's Ether concentration is changing!"""
pr_064930_0600#0,"""Could the embodiment be dissipating...?<br>What's going on here..."""
pr_064930_0610#0,"""Hey, Misato, that's..."""
pr_064930_0620#0,"""You, NERV people. Do you know what this is?"""
