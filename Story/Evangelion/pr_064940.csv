pr_064940_0010#0,"""Did you say... \""Angel\""?"""
pr_064940_0020#0,"""I did. That was one of the vast and powerful entities that NERV was created to eliminate. The enemies of all humanity...<br>We call them \""Angels\""."""
pr_064940_0030#0,"""There's no mistaking it...<br>That was the Sixth Angel."""
pr_064940_0040#0,"""B-but Misato, we've already destroyed that one..."""
pr_064940_0050#0,"""You have previous experience fighting that thing?"""
pr_064940_0060#0,"""Yes, it previously appeared in Tokyo-3. Shinji and Rei fought it together, and I can guarantee that they destroyed it back then."""
pr_064940_0070#0,"""Though as with all our battles, it cost us dearly."""
pr_064940_0080#0,"""These two fought it by themselves..."""
pr_064940_0090#0,"""This is impossible... It can't be back."""
pr_064940_0100#0,"""......"""
pr_064940_0110#0,"""Well, it would have been a piece of cake if Unit-02 and I were there."""
pr_064940_0120#0,"""I see what's happened. Just like Eva Unit-01, this Angel was embodied from people's feelings."""
pr_064940_0130#0,"""Just like the Eva? What do you mean?"""
pr_064940_0140#0,"""To follow on from what I was saying before, the Unit-01 that appeared in the Shop Area is a Phantom created by Ether particles."""
pr_064940_0150#0,"""There's a lot of things we don't yet know about Phantoms, but in general, an embodiment of something that already exists won't be a perfect recreation of it."""
pr_064940_0160#0,"""It's an embodiment of the image in someone's mind. Any blank spots where there's something they don't know have to be filled in somehow."""
pr_064940_0170#0,"""So what you're saying is, the fact that Unit-01 is different from how we remember it proves that it must be a Phantom."""
pr_064940_0180#0,"""Exactly right! You catch on quickly."""
pr_064940_0190#0,"""But why was it embodied in Oracle? Surely it would have appeared on Earth..."""
pr_064940_0200#0,"""My best guess is that ARKS heard of Evangelion during their missions on Earth."""
pr_064940_0210#0,"""We don't have anything like it here on Oracle, so it would have made a big impression."""
pr_064940_0220#0,"""The image in those ARKS' minds reacted with the Ether, and the result was this Phantom."""
pr_064940_0230#0,"""..."""
pr_064940_0240#0,"""I took the opportunity earlier to watch through our archived material on this subject. I have to say, I found it fascinating."""
pr_064940_0250#0,"""Anyway, moving on. That Angel before didn't have enough Ether concentration to maintain its huge mass, so it dissipated pretty quickly."""
pr_064940_0260#0,"""That's right! It vanished almost as soon as it appeared. Does that mean it's gone for good?"""
pr_064940_0270#0,"""No. The more times it appears, the more stable its Ether concentration becomes. Eventually, it'll be able to maintain itself for a long time."""
pr_064940_0280#0,"""A lot of people will have seen it when it appeared before, so their collective image of it will be that much stronger... Time isn't on our side."""
pr_064940_0290#0,"""So it's going to come back..."""
pr_064940_0300#0,"""If that Angel manages to stabilize, the ARKS ship will be in big trouble..."""
pr_064940_0310#0,"""Let's get some ARKS together and fight it."""
pr_064940_0320#0,"""We can use A.I.S. Vega to take it on."""
pr_064940_0330#0,"""If the Angel has the same capabilities as it did in the anime, it'll be a tough fight, even for A.I.S. Vega."""
pr_064940_0340#0,"""Oh, my..."""
pr_064940_0350#0,"""\""Angels can only be defeated by Eva Units.\""<br>That's the rule in the series, and we can expect this Phantom will follow it."""
pr_064940_0360#0,"""In other words, if you have an Evangelion on your side, you will stand a much greater chance against it."""
pr_064940_0370#0,"""Misato?"""
pr_064940_0380#0,"""Exactly. If we start preparing Unit-01 right away, it should be battle-ready by the time the Angel stabilizes."""
pr_064940_0390#0,"""Understood. ARKS will have our full cooperation in this operation."""
pr_064940_0400#0,"""You're really going to help?"""
pr_064940_0410#0,"""Of course. NERV's mission is to eliminate any and all Angels."""
pr_064940_0420#0,"""Misato, are we really going to fight this thing again? We don't even know anything about this world!"""
pr_064940_0430#0,"""Shinji..."""
pr_064940_0440#0,"""Listen to me, Shinji."""
pr_064940_0450#0,"""It's like you said before. We were brought to this world because there's something we have to do."""
pr_064940_0460#0,"""You mean, our mission is to use the Eva to destroy this recreated Angel?"""
pr_064940_0470#0,"""That's right. I believe this is our best chance to return to our own world."""
pr_064940_0480#0,"""You won't be on your own. ARKS will do everything they can to help, and I'll be supporting you."""
pr_064940_0490#0,"""...I understand. I'll give it a shot."""
pr_064940_0500#0,"""Thank you, Shinji."""
pr_064940_0510#0,"""Shinji..."""
pr_064940_0520#0,"""I'll protect you and the Eva with all my power."""
pr_064940_0530#0,"""Let's destroy that Angel together."""
pr_064940_0540#0,"""...<%me>. Right, thank you!"""
pr_064940_0550#0,"""Yeah, yeah. Can I get a word in edgeways here?"""
pr_064940_0560#0,"""While the great and powerful Shinji is off in his Eva fighting the Angel, what are me and First over there supposed to do?"""
pr_064940_0570#0,"""You want us to sing a song and do a stupid dance to cheer him on or something?"""
pr_064940_0580#0,"""Dance?! Asuka and Ayanami...!"""
pr_064940_0590#0,"""You... What the hell are you imagining, you pervert?!"""
pr_064940_0600#0,"""Ow... You're the one that said it."""
pr_064940_0610#0,"""Shut up, idiot."""
pr_064940_0620#0,"""..."""
pr_064940_0630#0,"""No, Ayanami! It's not what you're thinking...!"""
pr_064940_0640#0,"""OK."""
pr_064940_0650#0,"""While I certainly wouldn't mind seeing them dance, I have something a little more useful in mind for them."""
pr_064940_0660#0,"""Hey, what?! You're a Cast or whatever, aren't you? I mean, you're not human, right?"""
pr_064940_0670#0,"""Yes, that's right. To be precise, Xiera and I are High Casts."""
pr_064940_0680#0,"""I don't care what you call it! I'm not letting you chop us up and turn us into robots!"""
pr_064940_0690#0,"""Oh, no, I'd never do that. You're the only ones who can help me with this. Heheheh."""
pr_064940_0700#0,"""I've got a bad feeling about this...<br>Misato, help! Your precious pilots are in danger!"""
pr_064940_0710#0,"""Asuka..."""
pr_064940_0720#0,"""Asuka, that's enough. You're to help Ludmilla with whatever she needs. That's your top priority from now on."""
pr_064940_0730#0,"""Ugh...! Hey, wonder girl, say something!"""
pr_064940_0740#0,"""Or do you want to be turned into a mechanical doll?!"""
pr_064940_0750#0,"""I will follow my mission."""
pr_064940_0760#0,"""Ahh, you're always like this!"""
pr_064940_0770#0,"""Ugh... Fine, I get it, I get it."""
pr_064940_0780#0,"""I don't want to stay in this stupid world any longer than I have to. If it'll get us home faster, I'll do it."""
